			How to choose a dream dress?</h2>
			<p>
			Each girl dreams of looking perfectly at her own wedding. Someone has already figured in the imagination thought-out to the details, and someone else just flying in the dreams imagines everything is somehow foggy. But we all know well that the basis of this ideal image is a wedding dress, whose search is not such an easy task. After all, girls need to choose ONE, maximum of two best, most beautiful dresses among the millions proposed. Just a head rotation.</p>
			<p>
			In order not to be completely confused with the many existing options, we have compiled a list of tips that will help with this seemingly overwhelming task. Guided by them, you will help yourself with the choice of the very dress that will become the main thing in life.</p>
			<p>
			<b>The general conception of the wedding stylistics </b> is the starting point for understanding the dresses of which style should be considered, and past which need to go through a quick move. For example, a lush royal dress will by no means be a successful option for a small wedding in the circle of closest friends, Laconic and individuality will be suitable here. But if you have planned a feast for 100 or more people in the classical style, then why not, this is the very option.</p>
			
			<p>	
			<b>Time of the year </b> is a factor that girls sometimes neglected without considering that this is primarily your comfort. In summer heat and spring sunny day, light air cloths will be the best option. Emphasized by flood of sunlight dresses drop down can easily create a fairy tale image. If all the same the choice has stopped on a lush silhouette, do not forget about the subordinate, then it will not be so hot. A luxurious satin, taffeta and casual embroidery will be a great option for a wedding in the cool season. Dresses with long tracks are better to choose in dry weather, without foreseeable precipitation.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>The variety of spells </b> offered today allows you to highlight the bright accents and experiment with the bride's image. The tendency of recent years is increasingly dictating fashion to choose not traditional colors such as white, aviors or champagne. Capuccino, with pink, peach, powdery, lavender, blue or gray shades of dresses are gaining in popularity. </p>
